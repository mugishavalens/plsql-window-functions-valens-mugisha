-- Ranking Functions Example
-- Use Case: Top customers by revenue
-- Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), PERCENT_RANK().                                                                                                                    
-- Interpretation:
-- ROW_NUMBER():assigns a unique position to each guest based on total spending, so even if two guests spent the same   amount, their row numbers differ.
-- RANK(): gives the same rank to guests with equal spending, creating gaps in the sequence for subsequent guests.
-- DENSE_RANK(): also gives the same rank to ties but does not leave gaps, making it useful for leaderboard displays.
-- PERCENT_RANK(): shows the guestâ€™s relative standing as a percentile, helping identify top or bottom spenders proportionally.
